> The **Admin** page allows organization administrators to perform privileged functions.  The **Admin** page is separated into multiple cards:

> - **Users** display and manage users.
> - **Licensing** display and manage license and subscription.

## Users
> The **Users** card contains a list of all users.  Set a user's role to one of the following:

>> <u>User:</u> Users can view the **Dashboard** and **Explore** pages but are not able to make changes.

>> Set a user's status to enabled or disabled.  Disabled users will not be able to login to the application.  All users created after the initial administrator account will be disabled until enabled by an administrator.

>> Clicking the trashcan icon will delete the selected user after prompting for confirmation.
