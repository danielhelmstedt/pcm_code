# Overview
> PatchCableMgr offers two different deployment methods; hosted and self-hosted.
> - Hosted deployment method is the easiest and fastest way to get to get started.  Your PatchCableMgr instance runs on our AWS servers.  Server, OS, Software, and SSL maintenance are all managed by PatchCableMgr.
> - Self-Hosted deployment method takes more effort to get started, but gives you more control over security

## Hosted
> A hosted account is hosted on PCM servers. Everything related to server maintenance and support (server configuration, OS updates, app upgrades, SSL certificates, etc.) is handled by PCM. Upon registration, a tenant is created with a unique domain name (ie. acme.patchcablemgr.com) and database creating an isolated environment.

## Self-Hosted
> A self-hosted environment runs on your server
